some thing that seem necessary to represent a C++ - like language
	indentions are children of the unindented item or notes about the item

class-definition
	list of class variables(marked static/private/public/protected)
	list of class functions(marked static/friend/private/public/protected)
	list of inherited parent classes(marked public/private...)
	- you can imply a 'global' class to cover things that aren't otherwise in classes

scope-definition
	list of variables
		some variables are declared as inside the scope
		some variables are declared as arguments to the scope(function parameters)
		some variables also execute statements(like class contructors, or int x = rand() )
	list of statements
		some statements have subscopes(if/while/when)
		some statements exit/circumvent scopes(break/continue/goto/return)

function-definition
	namespace-name/class-name/function-name
	a scope-definition
	return-type
	parameters
	static functions could be implemented with a class-specific namespace

namespace-definition
	a list of variables
	a list of classes
	a list of functions
	- you can imply a 'global' namespace to cover things that aren't namespaced
